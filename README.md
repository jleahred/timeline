# Dart Polymer timeline component

This is my first Dart-Polymer program

It's a small component to draw timeline diagrams

Example on web folder


## Instanciating the component

```
  <time-line
      id="timeline"
      header="# Timeline"
      subject="This is a test of timeline (developed with css, polymer and dart)"
      url_doc="example.txt"
  >
  </time-line>
```
